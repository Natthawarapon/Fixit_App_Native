# AndroidCurrentUserLocation
Many applications now days use location to offer services to their users. Examples include many taxi ride apps like Uber. This project shows you how to get user location using Google maps.
The location of user is usefule to display locational features or to show directions. If you want to create an app that uses a client’s location then you are in luck. I am going to show you how to get user’s current location and display it on a map.

First get Google maps api key from their website by following instructions from their page. After getting the key and enabling billing, you have to enable maps api with any additional APIs you might need like Places API.
